Wanita itu bernama Red terus melanjutkan pernyataan pak tua "Kebanyakan pria tidak bisa mengendalikan diri-nya, menurutnya itu beban yang harus dilampiaskan, tapi seorang wanita seperti aku yang selalu menggoda pria yang ku puja, dia tidak sama sekali tergoyahkan, itulah yang ku semakin penasaran dengan-nya, kebanyakan pria di sini banyak menginginkan ku"

Pak tua kembali melanjutkan "Jika kau tidak bisa mengendalikan energi tersebut, merelaksasikan, kamu mensia siakan fondasi energi kita untuk kreativitas, intelektual serta kembali ke Allah."

It is an incontrovertible truth that the essence of a man's vitality, his very life force, is intimately bound to the s*minal fluid that courses through his veins. This fluid, far from being a mere physical substance, is the reservoir of his potentiality, the fountainhead from which springs his creative, intellectual, and spiritual vigor. To squander it in pursuits of fleeting sensual pleasure is to dissipate one's energy, to scatter one's forces to the wind, leaving naught but lethargy and dissatisfaction in its wake.

The high value man, in his wisdom and discernment, recognizes the paramount importance of conserving this vital essence. He understands that, by practicing s*men retention, he harnesses the power to elevate his existence, to transcend the base desires that ensnare so many in a web of mediocrity. This discipline becomes for him not a burden, but a liberation, a means by which he attains a state of heightened awareness, clarity of thought, and vigor of body and spirit.

In the realms of intellect and creativity, the benefits of this practice manifest with unmistakable clarity. The mind, unclouded by the dissipative effects of excessive indulgence, attains a sharpness of perception, a depth of insight that pierces the veils of superficiality. Ideas flow with greater ease, imagination soars to lofty heights, and the intellect wields its powers with a precision and acuity that commands respect and admiration.

Moreover, the retention of s*men fosters a profound inner strength, a resolute character that stands unwavering in the face of life's tempests. It imbues the individual with a sense of purpose, a drive that propels him towards the realization of his highest aspirations. This inner fortitude, born of discipline and self-mastery, is the hallmark of the high value man. He moves through the world with a calm assurance, a dignified poise that sets him apart, a beacon of excellence amidst the mediocrity that pervades the human condition.

Yet, it is not just in the enhancement of the individual's capacities that the value of semen retention is to be found. In the domain of interpersonal relations, the high value man, fortified by his discipline, radiates a magnetic allure, an indescribable charisma that draws others towards him. He commands respect, not through ostentation or force, but through the quiet power of his presence, the depth of his character, and the integrity of his actions.

The practice of s*men retention emerges as a cornerstone of the high value man's ethos. It is a discipline that demands the utmost in willpower and self-control, yet rewards the practitioner with a wealth of spiritual, intellectual, and physical benefits. Through it, the high value man carves out for himself a place of distinction, embodying the ideals of excellence and virtue that stand as the true measure of human worth.

### Mental dalam konservasi Energy


Setan yang serba tahu soal titik lemah manusia, dimana mereka bisa masuk mempengaruhi hasrat kita dan melangkahkan kita ke perbuatan yang melewati batas.

On s*men retention journey, one encounters not only the physical impediments but also the formidable mental obstacles that can obstruct the path to mastery over one's vital essence. Just as the external world exerts its influence on our desires and actions, the internal realm of the mind exerts its own dominion over our thoughts and inclinations. To navigate the tumultuous waters of s*men retention, one must confront and conquer these inner adversaries.

The most potent adversary standing in the way of s*men retention is the insatiable tyrant of lust. This incessant craving, driven by biological imperatives and the allure of sensual pleasures, relentlessly clamors for release. It is the sirens' song that beckons the unwary traveler toward treacherous shores. To overcome this formidable obstacle, one must cultivate a resolute willpower and a deep understanding of the transient nature of worldly pleasures. Recognize that yielding to lust is a fleeting pleasure that ultimately diminishes one's inner strength.

Fantasy is another treacherous adversary that often accompanies the journey of s*men retention. The mind conjures elaborate and seductive illusions that entice us to dwell on erotic fantasies. These mirages can be as compelling as they are illusory, diverting one's focus from the path of self-control. To counter this mental obstacle, one must learn to disengage from the allure of these illusions, realizing that they are mere phantoms born of desire. Instead, direct the mind towards higher pursuits and noble aspirations.

In the world outside, society exerts a powerful influence on our actions and desires. Peer pressure can be a formidable adversary for those aspiring to practice semen retention. Friends and acquaintances may mock or criticize such endeavors, leading one to doubt their commitment. To overcome this obstacle, one must possess unwavering conviction in the path chosen. Understand that the opinions of others are but fleeting echoes in the grand tapestry of existence, and the pursuit of self-mastery is a noble endeavor worthy of perseverance.

In the modern age, the allure of instant gratification is a potent adversary that plagues the minds of many. We live in an era of convenience and immediate pleasure, where patience and restraint are often seen as antiquated virtues. To navigate this obstacle, one must cultivate the art of delayed gratification. Recognize that true fulfillment arises from the restraint of immediate desires, and the rewards of s*men retention are not to be hastily forsaken for transient pleasures.

Lastly, one must confront the tempestuous seas of emotion that can threaten to capsize the vessel of s*men retention. Anger, frustration, and anxiety can lead to impulsive actions that undermine one's resolve. To master these inner storms, one must cultivate emotional intelligence and inner tranquility. Learn to navigate the waves of emotion with equanimity, for it is in the calm of the mind that the true strength of s*men retention is found.

To overcome the mental obstacles that beset this path, one must cultivate a strong will, an unwavering commitment, and a profound understanding of the nature of desire and pleasure. In the face of these formidable adversaries, one can emerge victorious, attaining mastery over one's vital essence and experiencing the profound benefits that await those who walk this path with diligence and determination.
