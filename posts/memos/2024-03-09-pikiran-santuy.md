First and foremost: don’t think of women.

Mungkin seorang pria harus bisa mengendalikan diri-nya soal wanita.

Lustful thoughts provoke activity in the s*xual glands.

Pemikiran nafsu bisa memprovokasi aktivitas orientasi seksssual

If we think of s*x, we shouldn’t be surprised if we suffer a nocturnal discharge.

But even a devotee seriously striving for brahmacarya may nevertheless be tormented by s*x dreams.

In the waking state he can control his mind with good intelligence, but in dreams low desires deeply ingrained in his subconsciousness may become manifest.

The real cure for this is complete purification of consciousness by devotional service, but as this may take some time, the several physical factors that affect the retention of sem*n may be taken into consideration.

Diet is important not to excessively raise the internal heat of the body.

Transcendentalists should eat simply and moderately.

By overeating, more energy is taken into the body than it can use, which tends to make it come out in the form of seminal discharge.

And an overly filled belly exerts pressure on the genitals, causing a tendency towards seminal discharge.

It is best to sleep no more than six hours at night and minimally or not at all during the day.

If one cannot rise early, his so-called practice of brahmacarya is simply a farce.

And late nights are bad for overall health as well as for seminal retention.

So best is early to bed and early to rise.

## Mengendalikan Hasrat

When one feels hungry or thirsty, one desires to eat or drink something.

When one feels hot or cold, one desires to have a cold or heat-producing food or drink and a similar place to live in.

When one feels the urge to attend to the call of nature., one desires to go to a lavatory.

When there is pain or itching sensation in any part of the body, one desires and thinks of gently rubbing or massaging that particular part of the body.

Such desires arise in the mind to meet a bodily desire but these can be avoided, suppressed, or controlled , if need be.

Suppose a young man see a beautiful woman.

If he is a debauchee, lascivious desires and thoughts come to occupy his mind.

On the contrary, if he is a celibate or a man of strong character, he does not cherish any carnal desires but instead looks upon her as a sister.

Lascivious desires and thoughts do not arise in man when he sees his own beautiful young sister.

That is because he has trained his mind in that particular way.

Thus, such desires and thoughts creep up in the mind according to the training imparted to the mind.

The mind works automatically in a particular way as a result of the early training it has received.
