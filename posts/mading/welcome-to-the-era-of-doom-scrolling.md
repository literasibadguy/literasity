When Steve Jobs introducing very first iPhone in January 2007, he showed people with full of surprises with "multi-touch" feature,  he showing live presentation with demo, using that iPhone scrolling full of albums in iPod app, Steve Jobs said "This is where Magic happens"

Steve Jobs combined three ideas that driving iPhone innovation, first iPod, Internet and Phone

Two things that inspiring scrolling today

iPod giving inspirations of entertainment, music and videos into scrolling that simulate our brain, hunger of being entertained, and they become so easier to access

Internet, giving the gateway, It means we may desparate of attentions

Phone, the root of communications today speak itself, that we're human have to socialise each other

Well today when we mention doom scrolling, I really focus on TikTok. TikTok have giving proof we are really dependents with these scrolling culture, not only taking our time, somehow It ruins our relationships too
