How bad can the Internet get before it gets better? Or will it get better?

Sooner or later, Silicon Valley has to clean up the mess they’ve made. Or if they don’t, politicians and regulators will step in. But they should fix it now, if only out of self interest.

All web platforms need to learn from the recent debacle at Threads, the much touted social media network that lost more than 85% of its user base in a few days.

As I [predicted here in painful detail](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/how-the-internet-went-to-threads), just a week after launch, Threads thwarted and manipulated users so extremely, few would stick around. And that’s exactly what happened.

The number of active users on Threads [has already dropped from 50 million to under 10 million](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/daily-active-users-metas-threads-071847316.html). The exodus took place over the course of just 40 days.

That’s not a decline—it’s Wiley Coyote at the cliff.

Even worse, the amount of time users spend on the app has declined 85%. Average daily use is less than three minutes per day.

Remember that these are _active users_—but they spend more time flossing. And probably enjoy that thread more than Mr. Z’s.

**In other words, we’ve now reached the point that Silicon Valley must change course—if only out of sheer greed**. Their apps won’t make money unless they give users a little more control.

They just gotta loosin’ up.

With that in mind, I’m sharing my wish list. Below are 65 things I want from a billionaire’s web platform, but so rarely get.

They ought to take a break from preparing for their cage match, and listen—otherwise they’re stepping off that same precipice.

1. Semakin banyak aplikasi di App Store dan Google Play, apalagi yang iklan-nya yang paling sering muncul di Instagram sama Youtube

2. Makin banyak iklan di sosmed kamu

3. Makin gampang registrasi-nya, makin susah untuk keluar-nya
4. Makin banyak notifikasi yang gak ada hubungan nya dengan kepentingan kita
5. Aplikasi pinjol makin banyak, cara enak dapat untung cepat banyak bisnis digital
6. 

    
    
3. Don’t make it difficult for me to figure out what’s an advertisement, and what isn’t.
    
4. Don’t force me to log in to change the settings for my user experience.
    
5. Don’t keep asking me to review your business on Yelp.
    
6. Please, please don’t make me assess a half-dozen different types of online tracking when all I want is basic privacy.

7. Don’t force me to log in and create an account just to read some text.
    
8. Don’t make it impossible to delete my account (I’m talking to you Threads).
    
9. Don’t send me an email that forces me to log in to read the rest of a short message (I’m talking to you Nextdoor).
    
10. And it’s even worse if you send me an email notification of a message that provides _none_ of the message (I’m talking to you Facebook).
    
11. Don’t blackmail me—taking away functionality unless I do your bidding (I’m talking to you Threads).
    
12. Don’t keep asking my permission to track my location.
    
13. Don’t make my online experience slower just so you can [punish your enemies and competitors](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37130060).
    
14. Don’t let total strangers put events on my calendar (are you listening Facebook?).
    
15. Don’t enlist hundreds of power-hungry bullies as your site moderators (Are you listening Reddit? Are you listening Wikipedia?).
    
16. Definitely don’t force me to phone customer service to unsubscribe (I’m talking to you _Wall Street Journal)_.
    
17. Don’t manipulate your click counts with articles that require me to click through dozens of items in a list article.
    
18. Don’t track my “health and fitness” info (I’m talking to you Threads).
    
19. Don’t annoy me with constant pop-up ads.
    
20. Don’t take away my block function—this is one of the few tools of control and empowerment at users’ disposal.
    
21. You can offer bright flashing colors for children, but please spare the rest of us. We are annoyed, not entertained.
    
22. Don’t force me to determine which boxes contain photos of motorcycles, and not explain if the driver and helmet are part of the motorcycle.
    
23. Please stop selling my private information. You only make a few dollars a year from this, and I’m even willing to to pay you to stop monetizing me.
    
24. Don’t access my webcam.
    
25. Don’t send all my private information to China (Are you listening, Comrade TikTok?).
    
26. And please don’t track individuals who never signed up for accounts ([TikTok again](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqbmk/tiktok-data-collection)).
    
27. Even better, halt all your surveillance efforts. You’re already making money on us via advertising—so at least show us enough respect to stop spying on us too.
    
28. Don’t keep forcing me to update software and apps I’m happy with.
    
29. Don’t make it hard for me to delete software and apps I’m not happy with.  
    
30. Don’t waste my time with stupid questions.
    
31. Don’t put ads in front of the text I’m trying to read.
    
32. Don’t access my contacts list.
    
33. Don’t use my posts to train your AI bots.
    
34. Don’t force me to use your messaging service (I mean you Facebook).
    
35. Don’t keep changing your layout so that old links no longer work.
    
36. Don’t delete old articles just to improve your [search engine optimization](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826342/cnet-content-pruning-deleting-articles-google-seo).
    
37. And, in general, don’t put up garbage articles because of SEO—because even if you get clicks in the short run, you will lose your user base in the long run.
    
38. Don’t force me to join your email list.
    
39. Don’t force me to click my acceptance of a 10,000-word terms and conditions contract before I even look at your bloody app.
    
40. If you’re cancelling my account because I violated a rule, let me know what rule I violated. Otherwise they aren’t really rules, merely the whim of the ruler.
    
41. There must be an appeal process, or you’re operating a tyranny.
    
42. Don’t send me urgent news about fires and other emergencies in my neighborhood—I’m talking to you Nextdoor—but wait two days, because your algorithm needs time to figure out what’s going viral.
    
43. Don’t force me to log in to unsubscribe from your email list.
    
44. If my social media account is hacked, don’t wait a week to respond to my query for help.
    
45. Even better, give me a phone number to call so I can deal with a hacked account immediately.
    
46. Make phone numbers available for other customer service issues.
    
47. If you do have a customer service phone number, don’t hide it behind a half-dozen click-through screens.
    
48. If your customer service call center is closed right now, let me know on the webpage before I waste time phoning.
    
49. Don’t tell me you have updated your terms and conditions without providing some brief summary of the changes.
    
50. Don’t remove functionality that users like—and definitely not because you want to manipulate them more intensely.
    
51. Don’t track my browsing history.
    
52. Don’t track my search history.
    
53. Don’t get hacked and let my credit card info show up on the dark web.
    
54. Don’t ask me which of your countless spam email lists I’d like to leave. The answer is always _all of them_.
    
55. Don’t send me the same marketing emails over and over.
    
56. Don’t collude with government agencies on silencing me.
    
57. Don’t create apps that I can’t access at my desktop computer.
    
58. Don’t track my purchases.
    
59. Don’t track the products I looked at, but didn’t purchase.
    
60. Don’t listen to my private conversations.
    
61. Don’t make me watch a video before I access your crappy website.
    
62. Don’t ask me to authorize cookies and surveillance even before I’ve had any dealings with your website.
    
63. Don’t impose cumbersome password requirements.
    
64. Don’t force me to change my password at set intervals—let me decide the level of urgency.
    
65. Don’t ask me to choose a number between one and ten to rank your customer service.
    

Or if you do demand a number, get ready for a big goose egg.

But wouldn’t it be better to improve your offering instead? I’m not expecting any billionaire to follow all 65 of my rules—but adopting a few would be a move in the right direction. That’s a no-brainer, because what they’re doing now violates every rule of customer service—and many rules of simple human decency.

And if the technocrats don’t do it willingly, somebody else will force their hand. If regulators and courts don’t, users will act on their own.

Take a look at Threads, where that’s already happened. And it could have been easily avoided by paying attention to a checklist like the one above.

Users rebelled, and it didn’t take long. The team at Threads is already scrambling to reduce the authoritarian policies. But it’s too late for them. They had their chance, and blew it.

The same thing will happen elsewhere. It’s only a matter of time.
